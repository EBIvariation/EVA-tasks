# EVA-tasks
This repository aims to contains the code used to perform one of tasks or any code code that does not belong to production repositories.
the code should be reviewed but might not need the same test coverage. 
The tasks code should be independent from each other so duplication is expected. 
If some features are required by multiple tasks then they can be refactored in a separate repository.
